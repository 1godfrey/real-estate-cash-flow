✍️ Overview:
I’m looking to hire a developer to build a simple but effective internal tool that finds cash-flowing rental properties based on Zillow listings and RentCast rent estimates.

This will be a private-use tool (not a public product) that helps me shortlist investable rental properties to feature in my newsletter. I do not know how to code, so it must be easy to use.

🎯 Goal:
Build a user-friendly tool that helps me quickly find 1–4 unit properties in any U.S. ZIP code with 8%+ cash-on-cash return and positive monthly cash flow, using basic filters.

🧩 Data Sources:
Zillow API (via RapidAPI) – For active listings, prices, bedrooms, addresses, etc.

RentCast API (Pro Plan) – For ZIP-level average rent by bedroom count

🧠 Business Logic:
The tool should:

Accept a batch list of ZIP codes (e.g., 100–300 ZIPs at once)

Pull active Zillow listings from each ZIP (single-family + 2–4 units only)

For each listing:

Get price + bedroom count

Use RentCast to estimate average rent for that ZIP/bedroom combo

Estimate:

Monthly mortgage (see adjustable settings below)

Monthly expenses (default to $300, or make configurable)

Monthly cash flow (rent – mortgage – expenses)

Cash-on-cash return (%)

Filter results by:

CoC return (e.g. 8%+)

Cash flow (e.g. $200+/mo)

Output results to:

CSV file (downloadable)

(Optional: Google Sheet or lightweight web UI)

🔧 Adjustable Settings:
Please make the following mortgage assumptions configurable (via UI, web form, or config file):

Down payment % (default: 20%)

Interest rate (default: 7%)

Loan term (years, default: 30)

Monthly expenses (default: $300)

💡 Output Format (example row):
Address Price Beds Rent Mortgage Cash Flow CoC Return Property Type Link
📂 Input Method:
I will paste or upload a batch of ZIP codes (100–300 at a time)

Tool should loop through each and return filtered results

This batch-style workflow is the primary use case

🏠 Property Type Logic:
Add a column for Property Type with only two values: Single Family or Multifamily

Use Zillow’s homeType or similar fields:

homeType == "SingleFamily" → tag as Single Family

homeType == "MultiFamily" → tag as Multifamily

Ignore other property types (condos, townhomes, land, etc.)

🌐 API Plans Being Used:
Zillow API: Using the free tier on RapidAPI (up to 500 requests/month)

RentCast API: Using the Pro Plan ($74/month), which includes 1,000 ZIP-level rent requests/month

Please implement ZIP-level caching for 30 days to reduce unnecessary API calls

🔄 Workflow:
MVP first: batch ZIP input → ROI filtering → clean CSV output

Potential Phase 2: visual dashboard or property-level deep links
